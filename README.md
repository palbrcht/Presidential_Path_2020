# presidential_path_2020

Had an idea to represent the potential pathways to victory for both Biden and Trump.

Used probabilities from 538 (thanks 538: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight) and ran a monte carlo simulation to simulate various possibilities.  The example below is only 100 simulations.

Ultimately, just wanted to make a cool visualization of all the potential possibilities, assuming voter probabilities according to 538.

Later on I want to go back and highlight the specific path that actually occured and maybe make a poster. Would be kinda cool.
